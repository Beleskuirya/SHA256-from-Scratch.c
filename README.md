# SHA256-from-Scratch.c
A simple and pretty straightforward implementation of SHA algorithm in a 256 bits output, purely in C from scratch

# Resources :
I used this pretty complete whitepaper, which describes the whole steps for the algorithm to work and each specifities of the variations of the algorithm https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/180-2/upd1/final/docs/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf
And this video, which illustrated the hashing process https://youtu.be/orIgy2MjqrA?si=xy4qR8vmR3kcOxM2

# What it does ?
The program asks you to enter a message, then it gives you as output the hashed result, simple as that

# How do i run it ?
You simply compile it in the terminal of your choice then you can run it !
